# Game Engines project

## 3D terrain generator

For my project I want to develop a procedurally generated 3d dimentional terrain, as I have always been facinated by their unmatched beauty in games such as Minecraft, and Civilization.

### Overview

For my world I would like to develop a finite world, that generates based on biomes and weather zones. Weather zones will be affected by height and latitude and biomes will add more specific details of a correlated weather zone. For example, it will be more likely to generate a desert biome closer to the equator, however there will be no hard boundaries to where any particular biome may occur. 

Apart from the basic components of a terrain, such as seas and mountains I hope to spawn in various different types of plants such as trees and flowers, in accordance to their biome. 

Things like grass, mountains and sea will all be textured appropriatly to provide greater detail and realism. 

This will be my target for the project, however if time allows there are many more interesting things that could take the world to a new level, such as:

- Generating animals with ai for movements
- Spawning weather
- Generating simple settlements
- Applying different art styles (Low poly, etc)

### Implementation thoughts

At this point, there is still research required into the techniques that would suit this project best. However, I can give a rough outline as to what techniques will be deployed in the project, and why.
